# Habbit Rabbit
habbit Rabbit is the backend server for the app called Habbit Rabbit.


## About Habbit Rabbit
Habbit Rabbit is an iOS App built with Expo and React-Native that tracks productive habits that you want to build and monitors your progress towards developing them. This repo holds the backend for that app. The Front-end Repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Gauraklein/habbitRabbit).

## Potential Future Developments
* Adding a method to track how many times a user completes a "habbit" verses how many days they have left out of 66 may be useful for users
who are interested in how many times they performed a particular habbit within the 66 days.
* Users might also like to know the last time they "checked in" to their "habbit." In order to make this happen a new table would need to be added to the database with id, habit, and time_stamp columns.
* Deploy the server and database.
